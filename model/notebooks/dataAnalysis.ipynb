       "2  altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness the word was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves e g pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another third party individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits the actor also may not be expecting a reward the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of one s self   \n",
       "3  in mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean ˌærɪθˈmɛtɪk ˈmiːn stress on third syllable of arithmetic or simply the mean or average when the context is clear is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection the collection is often a set of results of an experiment or a set of results from a survey the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics sociology and history and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation s population while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies it is not a robust statistic meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values notably for skewed distributions such as the distribution of income for which a few people s incomes are substantially greater than most people s the arithmetic mean may not accord with one s notion of middle and robust statistics such as the median may be a better description of central tendency in a more obscure usage any sequence of values that form an arithmetic sequence between two numbers x and y can be called arithmetic means between x and y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
